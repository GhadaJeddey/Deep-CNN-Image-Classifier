# Deep CNN Image Classifier
This project demonstrates how to build a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is designed to classify images into distinct categories using a deep learning approach. It can handle a wide variety of images and is capable of solving both binary and multi-class classification problems.

# Key Features:
Customizable Image Dataset: You can use any set of images to train and test the model.  
Deep CNN Architecture: The model uses convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features and classify images.  
Python and TensorFlow/Keras: The code is built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to create and train the neural network.  

# Prerequisites:
Python 3.x  
TensorFlow 2.x  
Keras  
Numpy, Matplotlib
